# Unexpected Styling Conflicts in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue in Tailwind CSS: unexpected styling conflicts arising from improper class usage.  The bug occurs when Tailwind classes are applied to components without thoroughly considering the parent component's styles.  The solution involves understanding CSS specificity and utilizing appropriate techniques to ensure styles are applied correctly. 

## Bug Description

The main issue occurs due to the precedence of CSS selectors. Parent styles sometimes unintentionally override child component styles leading to incorrect rendering in the user interface. 

## Solution

The solution highlights effective techniques to handle such conflicts.  Techniques like using `!important` (though not always recommended) or applying more specific selectors can be used to manage styles properly within a component tree.
